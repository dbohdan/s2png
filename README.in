s2png — “stuff to PNG”
==========================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dbohdan/s2png.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/dbohdan/s2png)

This program stores arbitrary binary data inside PNG images and extracts it back. It was originally developed by k0wax at <http://sourceforge.net/projects/s2png/>. The present version was created to fix a libgd-related problem that caused s2png 0.01 to segfault when compiled on modern GNU/Linux distributions. It has other improvements but remains compatible with the original.

s2png is licensed under the GNU GPL 2.0. See the file LICENSE.

Building and installing
-----------------------

1. Install the dependencies. On Debian, Ubuntu and Linux Mint you can do so with
`sudo apt-get install libgd2-xpm libgd2-xpm-dev`. On FreeBSD you will need to install `graphics/gd`.

2. Type `make` in your terminal and hit the enter key. Building has been tested on the following operating systems:

* Linux Mint 13
* Ubuntu 12.04
* Ubuntu 14.04
* Fedora 20 though 23
* FreeBSD 9.1-RELEASE
* FreeBSD 10.1-RELEASE

3. Install with `sudo make install` or use Checkinstall to produce an uninstallable package with `sudo checkinstall`. (In the former case you can uninstall s2png with `sudo make uninstall`.)

Usage

S2PNGHELP

Examples
--------

To store foo.mp3 in an image enter the following on the command line:

    s2png foo.mp3

A file named foo.mp3.png will be created in the same directory as foo.mp3.

Add the `-s` switch to ensure the resulting image is, give or take a pixel, square and `-b "some text"` to change the text of the banner at the bottom.

    s2png -s -b hello foo.mp3

To decode decode_me.mp3.png and get the original file decode_me.mp3 run the command

    s2png decode_me.mp3.png

If you got decode_me_v2.mp3.png as random_letters.png you could decode it directly to decode_me_v2.mp3 with

    s2png -o decode_me_v2.mp3 random_letters.png
