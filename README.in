s2png — “stuff to PNG”
======================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dbohdan/s2png.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/dbohdan/s2png)
[![AppVeyor CI build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/dbohdan/s2png?branch=master&svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/dbohdan/s2png)

This program encodes arbitrary binary data in PNG images that look like noise and decodes it back. It was originally developed by k0wax at <http://sourceforge.net/projects/s2png/>. This fork fixes a libgd-related problem that caused s2png 0.01 to segfault when compiled on a modern operating system and includes various improvements. It remains data-compatible with the original.

s2png is licensed under the GNU GPL 2.0. See the file LICENSE.

Building and installing
-----------------------

### *nix

1\. Install the build dependencies. On Debian and Ubuntu run
`sudo apt install build-essential git libgd-dev pkg-config`. On FreeBSD run `sudo pkg install git gmake libgd pkgconf`.

2\. Clone the repository and `cd` into it.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/dbohdan/s2png
cd s2png/
```

3\. Build s2png and run the tests for it with `make test` or `gmake test`. s2png is known to build correctly and pass the tests on the following operating systems:

* Debian 9
* FreeBSD 11.0-RELEASE
* OpenSUSE Tumbleweed (2017*)
* Raspbian 8
* Ubuntu 12.04
* Ubuntu 16.04

4\. Install with `sudo make install`. You will be able to uninstall s2png with `sudo make uninstall`. If [CheckInstall](http://checkinstall.izto.org/) supports your OS, you should also be able to create and install an uninstallable package for s2png with `sudo checkinstall`.

### Windows

You can download a Windows executable built from the latest commit from [Bintray](https://bintray.com/dbohdan/s2png/s2png-win32-bin#files).

To build s2png yourself you will need [MSYS2](http://msys2.github.io/). Install it and start the MSYS2 MINGW32 Shell.

1\. Install the build dependencies.

```sh
pacman -Syuu diffutils git make mingw-w64-i686-gcc mingw-w64-i686-gd mingw-w64-i686-imagemagick wget
```

2\. Clone the repository and `cd` into it.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/dbohdan/s2png
cd s2png/
```

3\. Get `sysexits.h`, which is required to build s2png, and modify `s2png.c` to use it.

```sh
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/freebsd/freebsd/master/include/sysexits.h
sed -i 's/<sysexits.h>/"sysexits.h"/' s2png.c
```

4\. Build `s2png.exe` executable with `make`.

5\. Create a new directory. Copy the binary and the DLLs it depends on there.

```sh
mkdir build/
cp s2png.exe build/
cp /mingw32/bin/{libbz2-1.dll,libexpat-1.dll,libfontconfig-1.dll,libfreetype-6.dll,libgcc_s_dw2-1.dll,libgd-3.dll,libglib-2.0-0.dll,libgraphite2.dll,libharfbuzz-0.dll,libiconv-2.dll,libintl-8.dll,libjpeg-8.dll,liblzma-5.dll,libpcre-1.dll,libpng16-16.dll,libstdc++-6.dll,libtiff-5.dll,libvpx-1.dll,libwinpthread-1.dll,libXpm-noX4.dll,zlib1.dll} build/
```

The contents of `build/` will run on Windows machines without MSYS2.

Usage
-----

S2PNGHELP

Examples
--------

To store foo.mp3 in an image enter the following command:

    s2png foo.mp3

A file named foo.mp3.png will be created in the same directory as foo.mp3.

Add the `-s` switch to ensure the resulting image is square (give or take a pixel) and `-b "some text"` to change the text of the banner at the bottom.

    s2png -s -b hello foo.mp3

To decode decode_me.mp3.png and retrieve the original file decode_me.mp3 run the command

    s2png decode_me.mp3.png

You can decode xyz.png to decoded.mp3 with

    s2png -o decoded.mp3 xyz.png
