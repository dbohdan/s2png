s2png â€” "something to png"
==========================

This program converts binary files of any kind into new PNG images and vice versa. It was originally developed by k0wax at http://sourceforge.net/projects/s2png/. This fork fixes the problem that causes the s2png 0.01 to segfault when compiled on modern GNU/Linux distributions.

Building
--------

1. Install the dependencies. On Debian, Ubuntu and Linux Mint you can do so with

    sudo apt-get install libgd2-xpm-dev libgd2-xpm

2. Type "make" in your terminal and hit the enter key.

Building has been tested on Linux Mint 13 and Ubuntu 12.10.

Installing
----------

    sudo make install
    
On Debian-derived distributions consider using

    sudo checkinstall
    
instead.

Usage
-----

    usage: s2png [-h] [-o filename] [-w width (600)] file 
        
      -h            display this message and quit
      -o filename   output the converted data (image or binary) to filename
      -w            set the width of PNG image output (600 by default)

Basic examples
--------------

To convert 1.mp3 into an image type the following:

    s2png 1.mp3
   
Now you have 1.mp3.png in the same directory as 1.mp3.

Suppose you need decode file DecodeMe.mp3.png. Type

    s2png DecodeMe.mp3.png

Now you have the original DecodeMe.mp3 in the same directory as DecodeMe.mp3.png.
